# BioPAX specification and examples
(Imported from sf.net/p/biopax, particularly - `http://hg.code.sf.net/p/biopax/code`, on 16 April 2015)

Final versions of the BioPAX ontology and documentation can be found at http://www.biopax.org/release/.

And, e.g., http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl is a stable official URI 
to use in the xml namespace declaration of a BioPAX Level3 data file, 
such as [this example](https://github.com/BioPAX/specification/blob/master/Level3/examples/biopax3-short-metabolic-pathway.owl#L4).)

## PS: 

New and Old BioPAX docs (archive) are still available at http://www.biopax.org/downloads/biopax/ (if temporary unavailable, try [this link](http://sourceforge.net/projects/biopax/files/biopax/)).

Very old BioPAX sources are still available in the CVS repository: `http://biopax.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/biopax/biopax/` 
(These have not been used since 2009 - deprecated, deleted, or moved to SVN, Mercurial, then Git. Kept for historical reasons only. _Do not use_.)
